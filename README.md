# US Rights
As a United States citizen, you are guaranteed certain rights. These rights are in the form of 10 amendments, also known as the Bill of Rights.
## Amendment 1

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  

This means that as a citizen you are entitled to worship whoever and whatever you want. The government cannot interfere with or favor one religion over another. There are some limits though, the government can interfere if what you are doing is unlawful. That includes actives that might involve human sacrifices. When you have free speech you can state your opinion and not get in trouble, unless you are threatening to harm someone. You also have the right to publish your opinions on newspapers, magazines, blogs, social media, and etc. without the government restricting you from doing so. The press also has these rights, unless what they are publishing involves slander of some kind. With all these rights you can do whatever you want, but it must be peaceful and lawful. As a student, you cannot skip school and go to a protest, and when you are caught and given a detention you cannot argue freedom of assembly. Remember, these rights protect you from the government, not everyone else. 

 
## Amendment 2

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.

 Basically, this means that civilians or the military has the right to keep weapons and they shall not be taken away.  

## Amendment 3

No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by the law. In modern terms this translates to that no military can live in a somebody else's home without the approval of the owner. 

This right has not been used in a Supreme Court case. If you think about it, there has not been a war in America in quite a long time. 

## Amendment 4

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath and affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 

To be translated to simpler terms, the government cannot search you and your things without good reason. If warrants are to be issued you need good evidence and they must describe where they're searching and who or what. There is a difference between stop and frisk and a full-blown search. In a stop and frisk the officer must have reasonable suspicion and they are searching for weapons. An officer can stop and frisk if they feel that their safety is being threatened. For a full blown search they need a warrant. In your homes you have an expectation of privacy. An officer needs a warrant to search your house. Their are special circumstances an officer can search your house without a warrant though. If you are running from the police and run into a home, the police can enter the home without a warrant, called hot pursuit. 

## Amendment 5

We have a fun video for you, about the fif amendment. 

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when is actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall e compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 

In simpler terms, you cannot go to trial unless a grand jury declares there is enough evidence to. A grand jury is a gathering of your fellow citizens who decide if you will go to trial. You can not be put in double jeopardy, or you cannot be tried twice for the same charge. A person cannot self-incriminate themselves. You cannot be forced to testify at your own trial. You also have the right to a due process. 

## Amendment 6

In all criminal prosecutions, the accuse shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.  

The Sixth Amendment guarantees that you will have a speedy public trial, by a fair jury, information of the charge against you, a confrontation with the witness against you, mandatory witnesses, a lawyer, and you shall be tried in the state and district where the crime was committed. 

The sixth amendment also includes the rights you have when you are arrested. This is called your Miranda rights, determined by the Miranda v Arizona case.  For example, "You have the right to remain silent" and, "Anything you say can and will be used against you!"

## Amendment 7

In all suits of common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. 

This means that when you have a trial, you must have a jury. This continues from English law in which certain cases had to be tried by a judge alone, while others required a jury. This only applies to Federal courts, but not state courts. The Framers carried this law over in to U.S. law.
## Amendment 8

Excessive bails shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 

This right is made to make sure that you will never be treated unfairly. In England during the 1630's a man named William Prynne was in disagreement with the king so he was tortured publicly. He was dragged on a horse, then hanged, and tortured some more. This was a very long, painful process. Thanks to this amendment you will not have to worry about any cruel or unusual punishment or outrageous bails and fines. Remember that this amendment only protects you from the government, not your parents. 
## Amendment 9

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain right shall not be constructed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

The 9th Amendment is used to stop government from increasing their power instead of limiting their power. On occasion courts can try to use the 9th Amendment to give and apply that are not really mentioned about through out the U.S. Constitution.
## Amendment 10

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. 

This means that any power not given to the Federal government is given to the American people or the states.

# PA Rights
You probably knew that the United States has a constitution, but did you know that Pennsylvania has one too? In fact, every state has a constitution! Every state has different laws that come from their constitution.  Some laws are shared between the PA and US constitution. 
## Right to Bear Arms

Did you know that the U.S. and Pennsylvania share the right to bear arms? In the 2nd amendment of the U.S. Constitution, it states, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." In the Pennsylvania  Constitution Section 21 says, "The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned."
## Freedom of Religious Exercise

The U.S. and PA also share the right of religious exercise. The 1st amendment of the U.S. Constitution it states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." The PA Constitution Article 1 Section 4 says, "No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth."
Equal Rights for Men and Women

Did you know that the PA Constitution and the U.S. Constitution do NOT share  the equal rights under the law for men and women. The PA Constitution Article 1 Section 28 states, "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because of the sex of the individual."
## Right to Free Elections

In the PA Constitution Article 1 Section 5 it says, " Elections shall be free and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage." However, the U.S. Constitution does NOT have this right in the Constitution.
## Rights to Privacy

In both the U.S. Constitution and the PA Constitution there is NO right to privacy.  It can be inferred though. In the right against unreasonable search and arrest protects your privacy. 

# Important Rights
There are many important rights. Here are some of the most important rights you possess.


As citizens of the United States we are entitled to protect our rights. We have the responsibility to keep popular sovereignty around. Popular sovereignty is about the people. Without the people you have no popular sovereignty. We need to protect our rights and the people in our nation from an unfair government. Without us, there is no government. 
## Freedom of the Press

Freedom of the press is very important. Without the freedom of the press we would not be able to communicate across the country freely. Without freedom of the press we wouldn't know what is actually going on.  Freedom of the press is a privilege. In many other countries the government runs the press so everything you see if pro- government. Freedom of the press is actually what allows us to make websites like this. If we did not have this right, all websites would be pro-government. You would not be able to announce your opinion to America about what you think of President Trump or any other government situations. Channels like FOX and CNN are not the only examples of freedom of the press. Blogs, websites, and newspapers are also freedom of the press. 
## Right to Vote

The right to vote is often under appreciated. Many Americans will not vote and they do not realize what a privilege it really is. In other countries, the voting process is closed to a few and often rigged. We need to encourage others to vote, even if you don't like the candidates. Voting gives power to the people. Without us Americans voting, popular sovereignty would take a backseat. America is a republic. Republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which means a public thing. Realize that voting is one of the most important things that keep our government in check. Many people complain of an over powering government and that there is nothing we can do to stop it. They are wrong though, voting is a public thing that helps decide the fate of many elections. When voting in the electoral college, the result of the popular vote will influence the electors vote. 
## Right to Free Speech

The right to have frees speech is very important. Free speech is speaking your opinion. In many other countries, people are silenced for speaking out against the government. We are very lucky to have this right. This right will keep every one up to date on everyone's opinions. Some opinions are right though. If the American colonists did not spread their thoughts on how the British government were treating them, we might be saying, "God save the queen." 
## Right to Bear Arms

The right to bear arms is a controversial right. Some people are for it and some are against it. I am for it though. The right to bear arms ,2nd Amendment, says that we are to have weapons. Do not worry though, we will always have this right. The government cannot repeal this amendment. They can make it harder to get weapons, specifically guns. Some people think that the Founding Fathers gave us weapons to keep the government in check. Some think that the Founding Fathers gave the soldiers the weapons to protect the country. No matter what you believe, you will always have the right to own a weapon. 

# Origin of your Rights
     
     Where do your rights come from? Your rights come from the Constitution or more specifically, the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution because the Anti-Federalists feared that our government would overpower the people and succumb to tyranny. The Bill of Rights is composed of the first ten amendments. 

     The states have their own constitutions though. The Pennsylvania Constitution is similar to the United States Constitution.  They both have similar rights in them. The Pennsylvania Constitution's third amendment and the U.S. Constitution's first amendment both state that men are entitled to worship whoever and whatever they want. They cannot be forced to attend any religious ceremonies and the government cannot interfere with or prefer any religion. 

     Though these two are similar, they are both different documents. If you would like to know all of them, please go to the website down below.  One difference is with the Second Amendment. In the Pennsylvania Constitution, it states, "The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned." This is for protecting yourself and your family. Do you see the word questioned? Well, that word means that the state government cannot even question it. There are some rights that are in the Pennsylvania Constitution that are not in the U.S. Constitution. The Pennsylvania Constitution has the right to clean air and water where the U.S. Constitution does not. The Pennsylvania Constitution also has equal rights under the law for men and women, the right to alter, reform, or abolish government, the right to free elections, and the protection against a standing army. They are both very similar though. The U.S. Constitution influenced the Pennsylvania Constitution greatly.
