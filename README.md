# About
## Our Goal

We made this website in an effort to educate United States citizens about their rights. This website was created along with Dr. Joe Harmon's 4C Challenge. More information about this challenge is available on his [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LkyRJN9gr8_SfZdP1cNci6OdiAWY6IB1nwxo4qCZP2Y/edit), or [his website](https://sites.google.com/redbankvalley.net/joeharmon/cool-tech/4cs)
