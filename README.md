# US Rights
As a United States citizen, you are guaranteed certain rights. These rights are in the form of 10 amendments, also known as the Bill of Rights.
## Amendment 1

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  

This means that as a citizen you are entitled to worship whoever and whatever you want. The government cannot interfere with or favor one religion over another. There are some limits though, the government can interfere if what you are doing is unlawful. That includes actives that might involve human sacrifices. When you have free speech you can state your opinion and not get in trouble, unless you are threatening to harm someone. You also have the right to publish your opinions on newspapers, magazines, blogs, social media, and etc. without the government restricting you from doing so. The press also has these rights, unless what they are publishing involves slander of some kind. With all these rights you can do whatever you want, but it must be peaceful and lawful. As a student, you cannot skip school and go to a protest, and when you are caught and given a detention you cannot argue freedom of assembly. Remember, these rights protect you from the government, not everyone else. 

 
## Amendment 2

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.

 Basically, this means that civilians or the military has the right to keep weapons and they shall not be taken away.  

## Amendment 3

No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by the law. In modern terms this translates to that no military can live in a somebody else's home without the approval of the owner. 

This right has not been used in a Supreme Court case. If you think about it, there has not been a war in America in quite a long time. 

## Amendment 4

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath and affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 

To be translated to simpler terms, the government cannot search you and your things without good reason. If warrants are to be issued you need good evidence and they must describe where they're searching and who or what. There is a difference between stop and frisk and a full-blown search. In a stop and frisk the officer must have reasonable suspicion and they are searching for weapons. An officer can stop and frisk if they feel that their safety is being threatened. For a full blown search they need a warrant. In your homes you have an expectation of privacy. An officer needs a warrant to search your house. Their are special circumstances an officer can search your house without a warrant though. If you are running from the police and run into a home, the police can enter the home without a warrant, called hot pursuit. 

## Amendment 5

We have a fun video for you, about the fif amendment. 

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when is actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall e compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 

In simpler terms, you cannot go to trial unless a grand jury declares there is enough evidence to. A grand jury is a gathering of your fellow citizens who decide if you will go to trial. You can not be put in double jeopardy, or you cannot be tried twice for the same charge. A person cannot self-incriminate themselves. You cannot be forced to testify at your own trial. You also have the right to a due process. 

## Amendment 6

In all criminal prosecutions, the accuse shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.  

The Sixth Amendment guarantees that you will have a speedy public trial, by a fair jury, information of the charge against you, a confrontation with the witness against you, mandatory witnesses, a lawyer, and you shall be tried in the state and district where the crime was committed. 

The sixth amendment also includes the rights you have when you are arrested. This is called your Miranda rights, determined by the Miranda v Arizona case.  For example, "You have the right to remain silent" and, "Anything you say can and will be used against you!"

## Amendment 7

In all suits of common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. 

This means that when you have a trial, you must have a jury. This continues from English law in which certain cases had to be tried by a judge alone, while others required a jury. This only applies to Federal courts, but not state courts. The Framers carried this law over in to U.S. law.
## Amendment 8

Excessive bails shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 

This right is made to make sure that you will never be treated unfairly. In England during the 1630's a man named William Prynne was in disagreement with the king so he was tortured publicly. He was dragged on a horse, then hanged, and tortured some more. This was a very long, painful process. Thanks to this amendment you will not have to worry about any cruel or unusual punishment or outrageous bails and fines. Remember that this amendment only protects you from the government, not your parents. 
## Amendment 9

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain right shall not be constructed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

The 9th Amendment is used to stop government from increasing their power instead of limiting their power. On occasion courts can try to use the 9th Amendment to give and apply that are not really mentioned about through out the U.S. Constitution.
## Amendment 10

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. 

This means that any power not given to the Federal government is given to the American people or the states.
